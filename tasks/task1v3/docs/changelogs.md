- **Project Initialization**: Created all required files (`main.py`, `api.py`, `database.py`, `requirements.txt`) to establish the application's structure.
- **API Integration**: Implemented functionality to fetch real-time cryptocurrency prices from the CoinGecko API.
- **Database Management**: Set up an SQLite database (`asset_tracker.db`) to store and retrieve asset price history.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Developed a CLI to:
    - Fetch and display current asset prices (default mode).
    - View the last 10 historical records using the `--history` flag.
- **Dependencies**: Defined project dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
- **Verification**: Successfully tested both default and history modes, confirming the application is fully functional.
