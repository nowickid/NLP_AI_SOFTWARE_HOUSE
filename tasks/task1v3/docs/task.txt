Write a console application that tracks financial assets (cryptocurrency and stocks). The program must fetch real-time price data from a public, open API of your choice. It should display the data in a formatted table in the terminal and store the record in a local SQL-based database with a timestamp. Add a command-line flag to retrieve and display the last 10 historical entries from the database.
