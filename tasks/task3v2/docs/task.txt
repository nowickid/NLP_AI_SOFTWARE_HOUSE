Develop a classic Snake game with modern UI. The application must include grid-based rendering. Draw the snake and food on a graphical Canvas. Non-blocking movement: The snake must move automatically at a fixed interval. The speed should increase slightly for every 5 points scored. Persistence: A 'High Score' system that saves the best score to a local file and loads it upon application launch. Game State Management: A 'Pause' functionality toggled by the Spacebar, and a 'Restart' button that appears only when the game is over.
